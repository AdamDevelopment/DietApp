# DietApp

This will be a diet app. Users will choose between options like low-carb, plant-based, or ketogenic diets and set the number of meals they want to eat each day.

**Stack used for app creation:**
* Golang (backend, server-side)
* React.js (frontend, client-side)
* Database - TDB (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB)
* OpenAI API (for recipe generation)
* Docker (for containerization)
* REST API (for communication between frontend and backend)
* JWT (for user authentication) - maybe
